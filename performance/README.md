# Performance 

Quite a subjective term. We can say that most of the time we will end up saying it depends.

What is the threshold ? How to measure it ? Does other factor weigh in and how much it matters ? 

As we know, the devil lies in the details.

## REST based HTTP API performance 
There are many tools available in market from apache benchmark, apache Jmeter. 

All tools comes from their pros/cons and here, we are focusing REST based HTTP API so I going to use [Grafana's K6](https://github.com/grafana/k6). Although we can use Apache Jmeter as well for wider things as well. 

Why ?
- Light weight, faster and cleaner APIs. Nice community support.
